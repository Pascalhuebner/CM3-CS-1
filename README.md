# CM3-CS-1
Hi, my name is Pascal Alfried Huebner, and I’m originally from Munich, Germany. I spent my high school years in Los Angeles and am currently in the process of obtaining my green card. I enjoy spending time with friends and making the most of life.

Right now, I’m working on turning an idea I developed in CM1 and CM2 into my own company. The project is centered around a website, so programming has become a key focus for me. Whether I end up coding it myself or hiring someone to do it, I want to have a solid understanding of the process.

I’m also majoring in Data Analytics, where coding plays a crucial role, so learning these skills is not only valuable for my business but also for my studies and future career.
